 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ehm1:0 "Bhenn'Thell Infesting Swarm"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ehm1_desc:0 "When you look at a Bhenn'Thell, you don't actually see it. You see the Host.\nMillenia ago, the Host, whose species name has been lost, had been infested by the Bhenn'Thell. They quickly lost all free will, and submitted to the Mind.\nWith the 'help' of their Hosts, the Controllers, the 'individuals' composing the Hive and infesting the Hosts, quickly grew and controlled their whole world, depleting a big part of its water in the process.\nThe Hive managed to control Faster Than Light travel, and is now looking at other stars, seeking new species to infest."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ehm2:0 "Mishar Great Hunters"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ehm2_desc:0 "The race called \"Mishar\" originate from the vast oceans of Rihi, their homeworld.\nWhile under the sea, they hunted as packs, preying on other races through diverse traps and ambush.\nThey nearly depleted their seas, and had to adapt to the vast jungles of Rihi.\n\nBut the air was toxic for most of them.\nOnly one of them, having been in contact of a strange animal left ashore, could thrive in these jungles.\nOver the span of a few hours, this strange animal, named the Caller, seemed to have unlocked psionic abilities in this Mishar, and after a few days, the hunt began once again.\n\nThe Mishar found some of its dead brethren, and used its psionic abilities to alter them so he could control them.\n\nOther Callers were found, but none of them had the same effects as the first one.\nThey were used to let some of the Mishar enter of state of semi-consciousness, while still being under the influence of the first of them, calling himself the Great Hunter.\n\nThe Great Hunt began, and with each slain and consumed creature of Rihi a new Mishar grew, everyone one of them bounded to the Great Hunter.\nThe Great Hunter and the Caller quickly depleted most of the biomass of Rihi.\n\nThey now turn their attention to the sky, eager to bring the Great Hunt to other worlds ..."
