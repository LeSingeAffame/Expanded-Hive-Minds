 ##### Starting screen
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_INFESTED_HIVE_MIND:0 "And so, at the dawn of time, we awoke. Our Controllers, blind and weak, were lost on our world. Slowly, they spread on our planet, until we encountered our first Host.\nAnd this is when the Mind came to be. The first Controller and the first Host became the leading force of our race, now operating as a single body.\nOver the years, we bound ourselves to other species. We kept the strongest one, as the others were not capable of meeting our needs.\nWhen we finally controlled our entire world, some stronger Controller were made by the Mind. They were to help our race in their own fields, and as such had a little autonomy.\nAnd we sensed it. Other stars. Other planets. Other species. We finally learned how to travel between worlds.\nThese species will join us."
 ##### Traits
 ### Pops
 trait_infested_0:0 "Infested (Basic Stage)"
 trait_infested_0_desc:0 "This species has been recently infested by a Hive Mind. The Host and the Controller are constantly fighting each other, and the Hive has to actively suppress the Host for it to submit to the Controller."
 trait_infested_1:0 "Infested (First Stage)"
 trait_infested_1_desc:0 "This species has been infested by a Hive Mind. The Host is not outright rejecting the Controller, but it is still not completely accepting the Hive."
 trait_infested_2:0 "Infested (Second Stage)"
 trait_infested_2_desc:0 "This species has been infested by a Hive Mind. The Host and the Controller have had enough time to get used to one another, but the cooperation is still not perfect."
 trait_infested_3:0 "Infested (Third Stage)"
 trait_infested_3_desc:0 "This species has been infested by a Hive Mind. Through genetic engineering, the Host and the Controller are in nearly perfect cooperation."
 trait_infested_4:0 "Infested (Final Stage)"
 trait_infested_4_desc:0 "This species has been infested by a Hive Mind. After a lot of genetic engineering, the Host and the Controller are in perfect symbiosis, and are better than the sum of their parts."
 ### Leaders
 leader_trait_infested_generic:0 "This leader is part of a species infested by a Hive Mind. Its capabilities depend on the cooperation between the Host and the Controller."

The Host and the Controller can now unite in a perfect symbiosis. Never should they suffer of their cooperation, they will thrive thanks to it."
